    <h3> Dear Families, </h3>

    <p class="Message">
        Dear Families,

        Welcome to Allen Park Elementary School! The lighthouse at the front of our school symbolizes our welcome to you and reflects our school motto, “ILLUMINATING MINDS”. Our goal is to prepare every student for success by providing a quality education in a safe and well-managed environment.

        Allen Park is an outstanding elementary school. Our vision is Today’s learners…tomorrow’s leaders. Our goal is to create lifelong learners who contribute by serving their community.

        We believe all children have unique and diverse educational needs and learn best in an educational environment which is structured to meet those needs. All teachers use the Florida State Standards as a guide for their lessons. The goal is that all children reach mastery of these standards. Kagan structures and differentiated instruction promote active engagement. We believe that students who are engaged are students who are learning. We look forward to working with you and your children, and invite you to be a school volunteer! A strong family-school partnership can only result in an outstanding education for your child.



        <br>
        <br>
